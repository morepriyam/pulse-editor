# pulse-editor

The native video engine behind [Pulse](https://github.com/mieweb/pulse): fast, simple, and built only on each platform's own media stack.

- **iOS:** AVFoundation (Core Media, Core Video, VideoToolbox)
- **Android:** Media3 (Transformer, Effect, Inspector)
- **No FFmpeg** on either platform
- A [Nitro module](https://nitro.margelo.com/): Swift and Kotlin, typed specs, no Objective-C++ shim
- Works with Expo and bare React Native through autolinking

## Status: migrating from react-native-video-trim

Pulse is moving every native video method it uses from its react-native-video-trim fork into pulse-editor, **one method at a time**. Each method is added here, switched over in the app, and tested on a device before the next one starts. The trim editor UI moves last.

| Step | pulse-editor | Replaces (RNVT) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `probe` | `probeVideo`, `isValidFile` | ✅ Done: tested on iOS (Android pending) |
| 2 | `merge`: passthrough join, trims, mute | `merge`, `onMergeProgress` | Next |
| 3 | `merge`: rendered edits (rotate, flip, crop, speed) | `merge` with `clipEdits` | Planned |
| 4 | `conform`: import normalization, including HDR | `compress`, `cancelCompress` | Planned |
| 5 | `thumbnail`, `extractAudio` | `getFrameAt`, `extractAudio` | Planned |
| 6 | `<PulsePreview>`: composition player | the preview screen | Planned |
| 7 | Multi-clip editor UI, in React Native on `<PulsePreview>` | `showEditor` (RNVT's native trim screen) | **Last** |

RNVT's file helpers (`deleteFile`, `cleanFiles`, `saveToDocuments`) don't move here; Pulse uses `expo-file-system` for those.

Every step keeps Pulse's output unchanged: the same saved clip edits (`editState`), the same 1080×1920 H.264 export, and the same recorder format. Existing drafts keep working.

## `probe`

```ts
import { probe } from 'pulse-editor';

const result = await probe('file:///…/clip.mp4');
```

Reads a local file's metadata without decoding it. Accepts a `file://` URI or a bare path, and rejects when the platform can't open the file.

```ts
type ProbeResult = {
  durationMs: number;
  video?: {
    codec: string;        // 'h264' | 'hevc', or the platform's id for anything else
    width: number;        // coded (before rotation)
    height: number;
    rotation: number;     // clockwise: 0 | 90 | 180 | 270
    mirrored: boolean;    // iOS only; always false on Android
    fps: number;          // average; -1 when unknown
    bitrate: number;      // bits per second; -1 when unknown
    bitDepth: number;     // 8, or 10 for HDR sources
    transfer: 'sdr' | 'hlg' | 'pq';
    durationMs: number;   // the video track's own (the container's on Android)
  };
  audio?: {
    codec: string;        // 'aac' | 'opus', or the platform's id for anything else
    sampleRate: number;
    channels: number;
  };
};
```

`video` and `audio` are missing when the file has no such track.

- **iOS:** AVFoundation's async loaders, requesting several properties per `load(...)` call as Apple recommends. About **2 ms per clip**.
- **Android:** Media3 Inspector's `MetadataRetriever`, one per file, closed after use, with its results awaited inside `Promise.async`.

### Tested on iOS

- All 24 of Pulse's fixture clips read correctly on iOS, including HDR (HLG and PQ), Opus audio, variable frame rate, 120 fps slow motion, screen recordings, and 90° and 270° rotations. A file that isn't media is rejected.
- In the Pulse app on an iPhone:
  - portrait, landscape and HDR imports come out upright and correctly letterboxed;
  - a draft mixing recordings and imports exports quickly;
  - the seed drafts export;
  - preview sizing is correct;
  - a recording interrupted by an alarm is kept.
- Builds with no warnings on iOS (device SDK) and Android.
- Android hasn't been run on a device yet.

## Development

Pulse consumes this repo as a git submodule at `modules/pulse-editor` and reads its TypeScript source directly, so there's no build step.

- **Where to edit:** make changes in the submodule inside Pulse, then commit and push here.
- **When the spec changes:** after editing `src/PulseEditor.nitro.ts`, run `yarn install` and `yarn nitrogen`. Commit the regenerated `nitrogen/generated/` files, because Pulse builds from source and needs them.
- **Updating Pulse:** in Pulse, `git add modules/pulse-editor` to record the new commit.
- **Minimum OS versions:** they follow the app's (iOS 16.4, Android API 24). Newer APIs are used behind per-method version checks, so older phones keep working.
